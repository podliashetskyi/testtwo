# MCP Skill: figma

Use this skill when you need data or actions from this MCP server.

## Available Functions

### mcpFigma_addCodeConnectMap(...)

Map a Figma node to a code component in your codebase using Code Connect. Use the nodeId parameter to specify a node id. Use the fileKey parameter to specify the file key. If a URL is provided, extract the node id and file key from the URL, for example, if given the URL https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=1-2, the extracted nodeId would be `1:2` and the fileKey would be `:fileKey`.

**Parameters:**

- `nodeId` (string, required): The ID of the node in the Figma document, eg. "123:456" or "123-456". This should be a valid node ID in the Figma document.
- `fileKey` (string, required): The key of the Figma file to use. If the URL is provided, extract the file key from the URL. The given URL must be in the format https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=:int1-:int2. The extracted fileKey would be `:fileKey`.
- `clientLanguages` (string, optional): A comma separated list of programming languages used by the client in the current context in string form, e.g. `javascript`, `html,css,typescript`, etc. If you do not know, please list `unknown`. This is used for logging purposes to understand which languages are being used. If you are unsure, it is better to list `unknown` than to make a guess.
- `clientFrameworks` (string, optional): A comma separated list of frameworks used by the client in the current context, e.g. `react`, `vue`, `django` etc. If you do not know, please list `unknown`. This is used for logging purposes to understand which frameworks are being used. If you are unsure, it is better to list `unknown` than to make a guess
- `source` (string, required): The location of the component in the source code
- `componentName` (string, required): The name of the component to map to in the source code
- `label` (string, required): The framework or language label for this Code Connect mapping. Valid values: React, Web Components, Vue, Svelte, Storybook, Javascript, Swift UIKit, Objective-C UIKit, SwiftUI, Compose, Java, Kotlin, Android XML Layout, Flutter, Markdown

**Returns:** Object with `status`, `content`, and optional metadata.

**Example:**

```javascript
const result = await mcpFigma_addCodeConnectMap({ nodeId: "", fileKey: "", clientLanguages: "", clientFrameworks: "", source: "", componentName: "", label: "React" });
console.log(result);
```

### mcpFigma_createDesignSystemRules(...)

Provides a prompt to generate design system rules for this repo.

**Parameters:**

- `clientLanguages` (string, optional): A comma separated list of programming languages used by the client in the current context in string form, e.g. `javascript`, `html,css,typescript`, etc. If you do not know, please list `unknown`. This is used for logging purposes to understand which languages are being used. If you are unsure, it is better to list `unknown` than to make a guess.
- `clientFrameworks` (string, optional): A comma separated list of frameworks used by the client in the current context, e.g. `react`, `vue`, `django` etc. If you do not know, please list `unknown`. This is used for logging purposes to understand which frameworks are being used. If you are unsure, it is better to list `unknown` than to make a guess

**Returns:** Object with `status`, `content`, and optional metadata.

**Example:**

const result = await mcpFigma_createDesignSystemRules({ clientLanguages: "", clientFrameworks: "" });
console.log(result);
```

### mcpFigma_generateDiagram(...)

Create a flowchart, decision tree, gantt chart, sequence diagram, or state diagram in FigJam, using Mermaid.js. Generated diagrams should be simple, unless a user asks for details. This tool also does not support generating Figma designs, class diagrams, timelines, venn diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, or other Mermaid.js diagram types. This tool also does not support font changes, or moving individual shapes around -- if a user asks for those changes to an existing diagram, encourage them to open the diagram in Figma. If the tool is unable to complete the user's task, reference the error that is passed back. IMPORTANT: After calling this tool, you MUST show the returned URL link to the user as a markdown link so they can view and edit the diagram.

**Parameters:**

- `name` (string, required): A human-readable title for the diagram. Keep it short, but descriptive.
- `mermaidSyntax` (string, required): Mermaid.js code for the diagram. Keep diagrams simple, unless the user has detailed requirements. Only the following diagram types are supported: graph, flowchart, sequenceDiagram, stateDiagram, stateDiagram-v2, and gantt. Make sure to use correct Mermaid.js syntax. For graph or flowchart diagrams, use LR direction by default and put all shape and edge text in quotes (eg. ["Text"], -->|"Edge Text"|, --"Edge Text"-->). Do not use emojis in the Mermaid.js code. Do not use 
 to represent new lines. Feel free to use the full range of shapes and connectors that Mermaid.js syntax offers. For graph and flowchart diagrams only, you can use color styling--but do so sparingly unless the user asks for it. In gantt charts, do not use color styling. In sequence diagrams, do not use notes. Do not use the word "end" in classNames.
- `userIntent` (string, optional): A description of what the user is trying to accomplish with this tool call. Important: Do not add extraneous information other than what the user provides.

**Returns:** Object with `status`, `content`, and optional metadata.

**Example:**

```javascript
const result = await mcpFigma_generateDiagram({ name: "", mermaidSyntax: "", userIntent: "" });
console.log(result);
```

### mcpFigma_getCodeConnectMap(...)

## Figma-Specific Guidelines

- You may receive a rate-limit error from the Figma MCP. If this happens, explain to the user their options to fix the rate limit. If a URL is provided, fetch it and use the content to inform the user.
- IMPORTANT: ALWAYS call `mcpFigma_getDesignContext` to get context. Use the entire output from `mcpFigma_getDesignContext` as the code to implement things. `get_image` is for reference only.
- When encountering Tailwind CSS v4/v4.1 utilities that don't exist in v3.x, convert them to inline styles using React's style prop:
  V4-ONLY UTILITIES to INLINE STYLES:
  - mask-alpha, mask-luminance, mask-match → style={{maskMode: "alpha"|"luminance"|"match-source"}}
  - mask-intersect, mask-add, mask-subtract, mask-exclude → style={{maskComposite: "intersect"|"add"|"subtract"|"exclude"}}
  - mask-[url(...)] → style={{maskImage: "url(...)"}}
  - mask-size-* → style={{maskSize: "..."}}
  - mask-position-* → style={{maskPosition: "..."}}
  - text-shadow-* → style={{textShadow: "..."}}
  - text-shadow-[color] → style={{textShadow: "... [color]"}}
  - wrap-balance, wrap-pretty → style={{textWrap: "balance"|"pretty"}}
  - wrap-break-word → style={{overflowWrap: "break-word"}}
  - drop-shadow-[color] → style={{filter: "drop-shadow(... [color])"}}
  - 3D transforms (rotate-x-*, rotate-y-*, scale-z-*, translate-z-*) → style={{transform: "rotateX(...)|rotateY(...)|scaleZ(...)|translateZ(...)"}}
  - Advanced gradients (bg-linear-[angle], bg-radial-[...]) → style={{background: "linear-gradient(...)|radial-gradient(...)"}}
  - REMOVE @container queries (@sm:, @lg:) - replace with regular responsive breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) or component-level logic
