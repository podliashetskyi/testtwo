You are updating an existing React + Express website for **“Max Flis & Bad AS”**.

Your task is to **improve technical SEO/indexability**, **update the UI theme**, and **extend the admin panel/content management** without breaking the current project.

Important constraints:

* Do **not** redesign the website from scratch.
* Keep the current structure, route patterns, and general layout unless a small safe adjustment is needed.
* Preserve existing admin routes, especially `/admin` and `/admin/login` if they already exist.
* Do not break existing API behavior unless required to support the requested functionality.
* Prefer incremental changes over a full rewrite.
* Keep styling and architecture clean and maintainable.
* Do not claim or hardcode anything that “guarantees” Google indexing. The goal is to maximize technical SEO readiness and proper crawlability/indexability.

1. DESIGN / THEME CHANGES

---

Update the entire website theme as follows:

* Remove any orange color usage across the site.
* Base theme:

  * Background: black or very dark near-black
  * Primary text: white
  * Accent color: yellow `rgb(244, 203, 69)`
* Use the yellow accent ONLY for:

  * primary CTA buttons
  * links
  * active / hover / focus interactive states
  * small highlights where appropriate
* Keep readability and contrast strong.
* Ensure consistency across:

  * header
  * footer
  * buttons
  * cards
  * forms
  * blog cards
  * portfolio cards
  * services cards
  * review blocks
  * admin UI where reasonable

Acceptance criteria:

* No visible orange remains anywhere.
* All pages are readable and visually consistent.
* White text on black/dark background, yellow accents only for interactive emphasis.

---

2. SITE STRUCTURE / CONTENT MODEL CHANGES

---

Keep the current structure and sections as they are.
Do not rebuild the website from scratch.

Add the following new content structure:

A) Services

* Create a public **Services** page with a list of services.
* Each service must have its own detail page, e.g. `/services/:slug`
* Admin must be able to CRUD services.
* Each service should support:

  * title
  * slug
  * short description / excerpt
  * full description / body
  * image if applicable
  * SEO fields if needed
  * language content for both Norwegian and English

B) Hero text editing

* Admin must be able to edit hero section text on all relevant pages.
* At minimum support hero content for:

  * Home
  * Portfolio page
  * Blog page
  * Services page
  * Contact page
  * Reviews page if applicable
* Hero content should support both languages.

C) Contact data editing

* Admin must be able to edit/change contact data shown publicly, such as:

  * phone
  * email
  * address
  * business name if configurable
  * opening / response info if present
  * footer contact info
* Content should support both languages where needed.

D) Randomized home page content
On each page reload, the Home page should randomly display:

* Services shown on Home
* Featured projects shown on Home
* Feedbacks / reviews shown on Home

Requirements:

* Randomization must happen from existing published content.
* Do not show drafts/unpublished items.
* Avoid duplicates within the same section on the same load.
* Keep performance reasonable.

---

3. MULTILINGUAL WEBSITE (NORWEGIAN + ENGLISH)

---

Implement full bilingual support for the whole website.

Languages:

* Norwegian
* English

Requirements:

* Add a language switcher in the public site UI.
* Add admin support so content editors can fill required fields in both languages.
* Public pages must render the correct language version based on selected language.
* If one language field is missing, use a safe fallback strategy and document it.
* Route structure may stay the same unless current architecture strongly prefers language-prefixed routes.
* All editable content types must support both languages where applicable:

  * pages / hero content
  * services
  * portfolio items
  * blog posts
  * reviews
  * contact data
  * SEO metadata

Do not hardcode translated text if it should be managed by admin.

---

4. ADMIN PANEL (CONTENT MANAGEMENT)

---

Confirm the admin panel exists and supports these actions. If something is missing, implement it.

Admin must be able to:

A) Portfolio items

* Create / edit / delete
* Upload images
* Set title
* Set short description / full description
* Set slug
* Manage content in Norwegian and English

B) Reviews / feedbacks

* Create / edit / delete
* These are internal site reviews managed by admin, NOT Google reviews
* Public reviews section/page must use admin-managed reviews
* Support both languages if review text is language-specific

C) Blog posts / articles

* Create / edit / delete
* Visible on public blog/articles section/page
* Support title, slug, excerpt, body, date, image if applicable
* Support both languages

D) Services

* Create / edit / delete
* Visible on public Services page and service detail pages
* Support both languages

E) Hero texts / page content blocks

* Manage hero texts for relevant public pages
* Support both languages

F) Contact data

* Manage public contact info
* Support both languages where applicable

G) Contact form submissions

* Store public contact form submissions
* Admin must be able to see a list of inquiries:

  * name
  * email
  * phone if field exists
  * message
  * date/time
* Read-only list is enough unless existing architecture already supports more

Requirements:

* Keep existing admin route(s), especially `/admin/login` if already present.
* Add simple validation for form actions.
* Add success/error messages for admin CRUD actions.
* Ensure public site reflects latest admin content.

Acceptance criteria:

* Admin can log in.
* Admin can manage Portfolio, Reviews, Blog Posts, Services, Hero Texts, Contact Data.
* Admin can see contact inquiries.
* Public pages reflect latest content.

---

5. FOOTER SOCIAL LINKS

---

Update the footer to include:

* Instagram
* placeholders for other social networks

Requirements:

* Use icons if available; otherwise text links are fine.
* Style them using the new theme.
* Yellow accent for links / hover states.
* Allow easy future editing of the social URLs.
* If practical, expose footer social links in admin settings as editable fields.

---

6. SEO / INDEXING BEST PRACTICES

---

Implement current technical SEO best practices for a React + Express website.

Public pages that should be indexable:

* /
* /portfolio
* /portfolio/:slug
* /blog
* /blog/:slug
* /services
* /services/:slug
* any other public marketing/content pages already in the project

Non-indexable pages:

* /admin
* /admin/login
* admin-only pages
* auth-only pages
* preview/draft/internal pages
* API routes

A) Route-level SEO metadata
For every public page, implement dynamic head metadata:

* unique `<title>`
* unique `<meta name="description">`
* `<link rel="canonical">`
* Open Graph tags:

  * `og:title`
  * `og:description`
  * `og:type`
  * `og:url`
  * `og:image` when available
* Twitter tags where appropriate
* support metadata per language where possible

Requirements:

* Home page: business-focused title/description
* Portfolio list page: overview metadata
* Portfolio detail page: item-specific metadata
* Blog list page: overview metadata
* Blog detail page: post-specific metadata
* Services list page: overview metadata
* Service detail page: service-specific metadata
* Contact / reviews pages: proper metadata if public
* Canonicals must point to clean preferred URLs with no junk parameters

B) robots controls

* Add `robots.txt`
* Allow crawling of public pages
* Disallow crawling of admin/internal routes where appropriate
* Include sitemap URL
* Do not rely on robots.txt alone to prevent indexing of private HTML pages
* Add `noindex,nofollow` or equivalent X-Robots-Tag for admin/internal pages

C) sitemap
Create a production sitemap.xml including only canonical public URLs:

* /
* /portfolio
* /portfolio/:slug
* /blog
* /blog/:slug
* /services
* /services/:slug
* any other indexable public pages

Requirements:

* Use a single production base URL from env/config, e.g. `SITE_URL`
* Exclude admin, login, API, drafts, previews, duplicates
* Include last modified dates if available

D) JavaScript SEO / renderability
This is a React site. Improve renderability as much as possible:

* Make sure important content is rendered properly and not hidden behind interaction
* Avoid blank-shell style pages as much as practical
* Ensure detail pages show meaningful content
* Add proper loading and error states
* Avoid soft-404 behavior
* If realistic without a major rewrite, add pre-rendering / static generation for public pages
* If not feasible, improve current setup as much as possible and document the limitation

E) URL hygiene and status handling

* One canonical URL per public page
* Avoid duplicate URLs from trailing slash / query params
* Handle missing slugs with proper 404 behavior if possible
* Do not index internal filter/search parameter pages unless explicitly intended

F) Structured data
Add JSON-LD where appropriate:

* Organization or LocalBusiness schema on the homepage / contact page using real known business info only
* BlogPosting schema on blog detail pages
* Service schema only if appropriate and only with real data
* BreadcrumbList if safe and useful

Do not invent fake business details, ratings, reviews, prices, or addresses.

G) Technical basics
Verify and fix:

* meaningful heading hierarchy
* one H1 per main page where practical
* descriptive alt text for images
* crawlable internal links using normal anchor links
* no accidental `noindex` on public pages
* no accidental robots blocking of public pages

---

7. CONTACT FORM

---

Ensure the public contact form:

* stores submissions persistently
* validates required fields
* shows success/error message
* appears in the admin panel as inquiries
* follows the updated theme
* supports both languages in labels/messages

---

8. QUICK QA CHECKLIST (DO BEFORE FINISH)

---

Before finishing, verify all of the following:

Theme / UI

* Visit all public pages
* Confirm black/white/yellow theme consistency
* Confirm no orange remains

Admin / content

* Submit the contact form and verify the entry appears in admin
* Add a portfolio item and confirm it appears publicly
* Add a blog post and confirm it appears publicly
* Add a review and confirm it appears publicly
* Add a service and confirm it appears on Services page and detail page
* Edit hero text and confirm it updates publicly
* Edit contact data and confirm it updates publicly
* Test both languages and confirm content switches correctly

SEO

* Verify public pages have unique title, description, canonical
* Verify admin/internal pages are noindex
* Verify robots.txt exists and is correct
* Verify sitemap.xml exists and includes public canonical URLs only
* Verify portfolio/blog/services detail pages have dynamic metadata
* Verify structured data exists where applicable
* Verify no SEO changes break routing or admin behavior

---

9. REQUIRED DELIVERABLES

---

Make the code changes and also create/update:

* `SEO_NOTES.md`

In `SEO_NOTES.md`, include:

* what was implemented
* which routes are indexable
* which routes are noindex
* sitemap location
* robots location
* required env vars (e.g. `SITE_URL`)
* multilingual approach used
* which content types support both languages
* any limitations still remaining because of client-side rendering
