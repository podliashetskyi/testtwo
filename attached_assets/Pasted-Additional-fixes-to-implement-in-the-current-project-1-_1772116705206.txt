Additional fixes to implement in the current project:

1. Prevent broken layouts from long text fields
   There are currently no proper length limits or overflow protections for fields like:

* title
* subtitle
* slug
* category
* excerpt
* other short text fields where applicable

This causes UI breakage in admin and public cards.

Please implement both:
A) sensible max character validation in admin forms
B) safe frontend display truncation / overflow handling

Requirements:

* Add max length validation for short text fields, for example:

  * title: reasonable max length
  * subtitle: reasonable max length
  * slug: reasonable max length and slug-safe formatting
  * category: reasonable max length
  * excerpt / short description: reasonable max length
* Show validation feedback in admin if user exceeds limits
* Prevent saving invalid overlong values
* Keep longer rich content/body/content fields unrestricted or much less restricted where appropriate
* On public pages, also protect layouts with proper truncation / overflow handling so cards never stretch badly even if legacy bad data exists

2. Featured item cards on homepage
   For featured services / featured projects / featured reviews or other featured items shown on homepage:

* limit visible text preview to maximum 3 rows
* after that, truncate and show ellipsis (...)
* do this cleanly with CSS line clamp or equivalent
* make sure cards stay visually aligned and consistent in height

This should apply where long titles/excerpts currently break the card layout.

3. Fix edit button visibility
   Current edit button color is effectively black on black and is not visible.

Please update edit buttons and similar admin action buttons so they follow the site theme:

* yellow background or yellow-accent visible style
* strong contrast
* visible hover/focus states
* consistent with the new black / white / yellow design system

Apply this wherever the current action/edit buttons are hard to see.

4. Local image upload from computer in admin
   Admin must be able to upload images directly from local computer, not only paste image URLs.

Implement image upload for relevant content types:

* portfolio items
* blog posts if applicable
* services
* any other content type already using images

Requirements:

* max file size: 5 MB
* allow common image extensions / mime types:

  * .jpg
  * .jpeg
  * .png
  * .webp
* validate both file type and file size
* show clear success/error messages
* store uploaded files in the project’s existing suitable location or storage flow
* save the resulting image path/URL to the existing content model
* keep backward compatibility with existing image URL fields if they already exist
* if practical, allow both:

  * upload from local computer
  * manual image URL input

Also:

* ensure uploaded images display correctly on public pages
* avoid breaking existing seeded/demo content
* document any new upload folder, endpoint, config, or storage behavior in the implementation summary

Acceptance criteria for this additional task:

* long titles/subtitles/slugs/categories/excerpts no longer break layout
* homepage featured card text is limited to 3 rows with ellipsis
* edit buttons are clearly visible in yellow-accent style
* admin can upload local images up to 5 MB in common formats
* invalid files show proper validation errors
* uploaded images appear correctly in admin and on public pages
